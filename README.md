# CP2-Final-Project Web Clock

Regarding my final project, I will program a web clock based on the web clock example I showed last time in class. And explore more JS and HTML functions to make the animation more smooth and gorgeous.


## Summary

I will program a webpage clock based on HTML & JS. In the JS part, I will complete the basic functions of the webpage clock, so that the program can run normally. In the HTML section, I will explore how to put JS code on an HTML webpage and make it run permanently (if the server is always running) and make the webpage more beautiful.

## Challenges

Whether Web Clock can convert the displayed language according to the system language.

Is it possible to make Wab Clock into a desktop plug-in, so that the program is free from the restrictions of the web page.

How to make the interface of Web Clock look better, add the interaction of mouse and Web Clock, let users have more fun when using, instead of just displaying the time.
